# Review System Testing Guide

## Manual Testing Checklist

### 1. Review Display Testing

#### Test Cases:
- [ ] Navigate to any product page (e.g., http://localhost:3000/product/1)

- Loading states work properly
- Error states show helpful messages
- Empty state encourages first review

### 2. Review Submission Testing

#### Test Cases:
- [ ] Click "Write Review" button
- [ ] Modal should open with review form
- [ ] Test star rating interaction (click stars)

- [ ] Verify changes reflect immediately

#### Expected Results:
- Edit/delete buttons only appear for user's own reviews
- Edit modal pre-populates with existing data

- UI updates in real-time

### 4. Review Statistics Testing

#### Test Cases:
- [ ] Navigate to product with multiple reviews
- [ ] Verify average rating calculation
- [ ] Check rating breakdown bar chart
- [ ] Test sorting options (newest, oldest, highest rating, lowest rating)
- [ ] Test pagination if more than 10 reviews

#### Expected Results:
- Statistics accurately reflect review data
- Sorting changes review order correctly
- Pagination works smoothly
- All UI elements are responsive

### 5. Responsive Design Testing

#### Test Cases:
- [ ] Test on mobile viewport (< 768px)
- [ ] Test on tablet viewport (768px - 1024px)
- [ ] Test on desktop viewport (> 1024px)
- [ ] Verify touch interactions work on mobile
- [ ] Check that modals are properly sized

#### Expected Results:
- All components adapt to screen size

### 6. Error Handling Testing

#### Test Cases:

- [ ] Submit extremely long review text

#### Expected Results:
- Network errors show retry button
- Authentication errors show appropriate messages
- Authorization is properly enforced
- Input validation prevents XSS and other issues

## Automated Testing Commands

```bash
# Run component tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern=reviews

# Run type checking
npm run type-check

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Build for production to test for build errors
npm run build
```

## API Endpoint Testing

You can test the API endpoints directly:

```bash
# Get reviews for product ID 1
curl -H "Accept: application/json" \
     "http://localhost:8000/api/reviews?product_id=1"

# Get review stats for product ID 1
curl -H "Accept: application/json" \
     "http://localhost:8000/api/reviews/stats?product_id=1"
```

## Success Criteria

✅ **All test cases pass**  
✅ **No console errors in browser**  
✅ **Responsive design works on all devices**  
✅ **API integrations work correctly**  
✅ **User authorization is properly enforced**  
✅ **Error states are handled gracefully**  
✅ **Performance is acceptable (< 3s load time)**

## Known Limitations

1. **Pagination**: Currently loads 10 reviews per page
2. **Image Support**: Reviews don't support image uploads yet
