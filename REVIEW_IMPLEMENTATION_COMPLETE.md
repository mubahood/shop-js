- **Modal Integration**: Review form opens in a modal dialog
- **State Management**: Proper React state handling for modal visibility
- **Navigation**: Quick navigation sidebar includes "Reviews" section

### API Integration
Complete backend integration with the Laravel API:

- **Authentication**: Proper user authentication for review actions
- **Authorization**: Backend authorization checks for edit/delete operations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Data Validation**: Frontend and backend validation for review data

## üì± Responsive Design

### Mobile (< 768px)
- Touch-friendly star rating
- Optimized button sizes
- Stacked layout for easy scrolling
- Modal forms sized for mobile screens

### Tablet (768px - 1024px)  
- Balanced layout with adequate spacing
- Touch and mouse interactions
- Optimized for both portrait and landscape

### Desktop (> 1024px)
- Full-width review statistics
- Hover effects on interactive elements
- Efficient use of screen real estate
- Advanced sorting and filtering options

## üîí Security & Authorization

### User Authentication
- Review submission requires user login
- Guest users see invitation to sign in
- Proper token-based authentication

### Authorization Controls
- Users can only edit/delete their own reviews
- Backend validation prevents unauthorized actions
- Frontend UI hides edit/delete buttons for other users' reviews

### Data Validation
- Star rating required (1-5 stars)
- Comment text required and limited to 1000 characters
- XSS protection through proper input sanitization
- SQL injection prevention through Eloquent ORM

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations

### Frontend Optimizations
