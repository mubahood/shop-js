# Auth Layout Improvements Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Layout Structure**
- **Before**: Used fixed positioning with manual width calculations (50vw)
- **After**: Uses modern flexbox layout for perfect 50/50 split and better responsiveness

### 2. **Content Centering**
- **Before**: Content wasn't perfectly centered vertically and horizontally
- **After**: Both branding panel and form panel use `display: flex` with `justify-content: center` and `align-items: center`

### 3. **Balance & Spacing**
- **Before**: Inconsistent padding and spacing between left and right sides
- **After**: Matching padding (4rem 3rem) and consistent spacing on both sides

### 4. **Visual Enhancements**
- Added subtle background pattern to form panel for depth
- Improved feature items with borders and better hover effects
- Enhanced animations with fadeInUp keyframes
- Better form styling with improved buttons and social login appearance
